            <p>According to <a href="https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2" >the African Union</a>, West Africa contains Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. Located in the Sahel and south to the coast, this region has the largest GDP of the regions of Africa, powered by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1120999/gdp-of-african-countries-by-country/">Nigeria, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire</a>. Widely spread stereotypes and assumptions of the economics of African countries discredit them from the credit they deserve for growing economically after colonialism.</p>
            <p>The map and coordinated bar chart below depict various economic indicators related to GDP, including exports and imports of goods and services, fiscal expenditures, fiscal revenue (excluding grants), gross savings and investments. The data was collected from the <a href="https://data.imf.org/?sk=5778f645-51fb-4f37-a775-b8fecd6bc69b&sId=1390030341854">International Monetary Fund</a>. Use the dropdown menu to toggle between the economic indicators and hover over the map or bar chart to retrieve the country and its data. As a side note, Liberia's Gross Savings value is actually -1.7%, but it is depicted as 0%, so that the bar chart could properly work.</p>
